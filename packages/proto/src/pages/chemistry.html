    <h1>Why deglaze with wine?</h1>
    <p>Deglazing a pan with wine is a great idea because it adds incredible depth and flavor to your dish while making good use of all the tasty browned bits—called fond—that stick to the bottom of the pan after searing meat or vegetables. When you pour in a splash of wine and stir, it loosens those caramelized bits and dissolves them into a rich, flavorful base for sauces or gravies. Wine also brings its own acidity and complexity, enhancing the overall taste and helping balance richer ingredients like butter or cream. It's a simple technique that transforms everyday cooking into something more refined and delicious.</p>
